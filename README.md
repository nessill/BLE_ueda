# blephytracking
This repository includes the code for BLE physical-layer fingerprinting project. 

BLE_Fingerprinting_example2.m reads 20 example BLE signals received by a Software Defined Radio (SDR) over the air, and extracts physical layer fingerprints of those signals. The first 10 signal belong to one transmitted device and the next 10 signals belong to a different device.
